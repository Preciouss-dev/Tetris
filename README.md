# Tetris Game

Building my all time childhood favourite game while re-learning python concepts. I have created the shapes in grid format, this makes it easier for the shapes to take different structures when playing and the change in shapes is enable by "import random" which gives us random shapes at a time and colours. Challenges faced was getting the right size for the shapes to fit the screen and and rotate accordingly.

To install you need to have python3 and an IDE of your choice (i used vs code) and install pygame to enable the graphics of the game.

When paying the game:

Up arrow - for changing the direction of the shape
Down arrow - shape goes down fast
Right arrow - goes right
Left arrow - goes left
Space bar - shape goes down fast
